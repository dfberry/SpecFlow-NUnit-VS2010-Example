This Windows Visual Studio 2010 solution contains 2 class library projects. The calculator project contains the calculator class. The spec project contains the specflow/nunit tests. 

I couldn't get this to run from inside Visual Studio but it does run the test from NUnit. 

This was my attempt to try SpecFlow at it's most basical without anything else around. I needed NUnit to run the SpecFlow test. NUnit also allows continous integration (via settings) which MSTest doesn't allow easily.
